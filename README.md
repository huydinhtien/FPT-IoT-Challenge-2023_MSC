# Machine learning Algorithm for Activity Classification
## What is Machine learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms analyze large datasets, find patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on the information they've learned. This technology has significantly impacted industries and continues to drive innovation and automation in a wide range of applications. In this project, we use the Decision tree algorithm to train a human activity classification model which will be embedded to a wearable device for real-time activity monitoring.

## What is Decision tree?
Decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a visual representation of a decision-making process that resembles an upside-down tree. Decision trees work by recursively splitting data into subsets based on the most significant attributes or features. At each internal node of the tree, a decision is made, and branches are created that lead to child nodes. These decisions continue until a leaf node is reached, which contains the final classification or regression prediction.
## How we apply Machine learning in this project?
In this project, we developed a classification model for five basic activities: lying, sitting, standing, walking, and jogging using Decision tree. The model with the highest accuracy will be exported and embedded on a microcontroller.

# Motion Care BLE Mobile Application
This is the source code for the Motion Care Android mobile application.

## What is Motion Care BLE mobile app? 
Motion Care will use for monitoring the activiy of the users! With Motion Care, you can quickly see whatâ€™s activity that the user is taking.

## How does it work? 
Using Motion Care BLE mobile app is easy. It runs on your Android mobile devices such as a smartphone or tablet. It utilizes the Bluetooth adapter on the mobile to scan, connect and interact with nearby BLE hardware.

After connecting the Motion Care app and BLE hardware (e.g., our wearable device), the wearable device shows a green light indicating when your setup is ready to go. The app will instantly recognize some daily basic activities including lying, sitting, standing, walking and jogging.
